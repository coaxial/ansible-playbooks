- name: Change hostname
  # TODO use variables!
  # TODO consider making this a role or a command
  # Has to be done with a raw command because there are no good modules to do
  # this. The sed inplace is crucial because sudo tries to resolve the local
  # hostname, and will take forever (i.e. over 12s) to run if it can't resolve;
  # which will in turn crash ansible because it will wait for an elevated
  # prompt too long (timeout defined as the SSH timeout in ansible.cfg)
  # outputting a message when hostname modified for changed_when
  raw: grep -q mainframe /etc/hosts || (sudo sed -i 's/127\.0\.1\.1.*/127\.0\.1\.1\tmainframe/g' /etc/hosts && sudo hostnamectl set-hostname mainframe && printf 'hostname updated')
  register: change_hostname
  changed_when: change_hostname.stdout == 'hostname updated'
